<h2><a name="AT_LENNOX" id="AT_LENNOX"></a>AT LENNOX.</h2>

<p>The silver birch, on the mountain top, laughed for sheer joy of being
alive!</p>

<p>She looked down on the valley and saw the peaceful farms and the green
meadow, where man’s only labour was driving a ball from hole to hole,
and beyond she saw the gentle slopes of wooded hills and the pure gold
of the setting sun and she was happy, for was not all this created just
for her!</p>

<p>So she laughed, and every leaf fluttered for joy!<a name="page_042" id="page_042"></a></p>

<h2><a name="THE_FLOWER_OF_TRUE_HAPPINESS" id="THE_FLOWER_OF_TRUE_HAPPINESS"></a>THE FLOWER OF TRUE HAPPINESS.</h2>

<p>The Flower of Happiness grows in the fields of the Poor and in the
gardens of the Rich and may be gathered by all who want it and have the
will to reach for it. It hangs high up on the Tree of Life though, and
many never see it at all. They are so busy digging for gold or weeping
over graves, they forget to look up. Even amongst those who do see it
many are afraid to pluck it, fearing its beauty and fragrance might
injure their souls. Others strive for it; but the rock, on which they
stand, is so overlaid with greed and lust that, when the Flower is
within their reach, they slip, clutching but a broken stalk.</p>

<p>A few only, with their feet firmly planted on the plane of moderation
and their faces turned towards God, gather this wondrous Flower. At
moments it may wilt; but the true<a name="page_043" id="page_043"></a> Flower always revives, and whiffs of
its sweetness go to gladden many hearts as they, who have plucked it,
walk amongst their fellow-men.<a name="page_044" id="page_044"></a></p>

<h2><a name="THE_MOUNTAIN_TOP" id="THE_MOUNTAIN_TOP"></a>THE MOUNTAIN TOP.</h2>

<p>A man of mature years and thoughtful mien was slowly ascending the
mountain slopes when he met the good minister, with prayer book under
arm, on his way to church.</p>

<p>“My dear sir,” said the latter, “your steps have passed the House of
God, and this the Sabbath morn!”</p>

<p>The other answered: “The house of man, you mean. I go to the House of
God, the mountain top, with its foundation of finite rock and its roof
of infinite space; and there, from the finite my soul aspires to the
infinite, from sin to perfection, from the known to the ideal, from
disorder to harmony, from man to God.”</p>

<p>“This too, I preach,” said the good minister.</p>

<p>“And so do the Rabbi, the Brahman and the priests of the many religions
and sects of this world,” replied the other. “But each explains the
great mystery in his own way and<a name="page_045" id="page_045"></a> the many ways confuse me and so, as
alone I must one day meet my God, alone now I seek Him on the mountain
top.”</p>

<p>“Let not our many ways trouble you,” said the good minister, with a
kindly smile. “If you really have our common goal in your heart, you
need not climb to the mountain top to find the House of God; because
then you will know it is everywhere, as God is everywhere!”<a name="page_046" id="page_046"></a></p>

<h2><a name="CHARITY" id="CHARITY"></a>CHARITY.</h2>

<p>A lovable and beautiful maid was Charity, yet withal thoughtless and
somewhat vain. She was admired and “God-blessed” by all men, for what
beggar did she ever repulse! And for each coin she dropped into a
beggar’s hand, what treasure was she not storing up for herself in the
wonderful kingdom to come!</p>

<p>But some of the beggars began to whisper among themselves that it was
not fair that she should receive such great reward for doing so very
little, and that the scattered coins vanished almost as soon as they
touched their outstretched hands, and that misery was everywhere.</p>

<p>At last these murmurings reached Charity herself and they bewildered
her. So she looked more closely at the beggars and she saw here a blind
one, there a lame one, and many, many who were sick and weary, and her
heart was touched. So she came down from her pedestal<a name="page_047" id="page_047"></a> and soothed and
comforted the needy, even finding cures for a few of them. Now she was
admired and loved more than ever, and greater than ever she felt was
that future reward she was heaping up for herself.</p>

<p>But some of the beggars again began to whisper that everything was not
right, that perhaps after all it was not Charity they wanted, and again
Charity heard, and she looked at the beggars yet more closely and she
found in every face the promise of something better, if she could but
reach it. So she called all the Sciences and all the Arts to her aid and
for long they communed together. Then the Sciences and the Arts went to
work, accompanied by a sweet and perfect Charity, who now sought her
only reward in her power to serve and to love, and they found the roots
of the many evils that beset the world and one by one they destroyed
them.</p>

<p>No angry whisperings now, no gruesome beggars more; but soft laughter
and willing helpers everywhere abound.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
